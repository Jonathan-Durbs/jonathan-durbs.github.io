I apologize for this update, it has been two months since this session and I did not seem to have taken any notes opting to be a more active member of the party.

We began a combat with the champion, he called two or three chimeras into the room. We dispatched the chimeras fairly quickly and dealt a fair amount of damage to the champion, he teleported near a hallway to another tent and run down the hallway.

In that tent we fought puppets, cutting their strings, and once again did some damage to him. We fought him again in a different tent until finally in the third tent he went supernova. He took to the air making it rather difficult to deal damage until Roland commanded him to fall. When we finally dispatched him we all passed out and saw a flashback of his.
