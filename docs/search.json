The survey was conducted in September and October 2023 with analysis conducted in November and September and the writing of the report done in December and January. Dr. Kuehl and Eman Alahmadi have gone on to use resulting survey experiment data in a paper which has hit the R&R stage. Oliver Myers wrote the bulk of the survey and report with me doing the copy editing. I created the graphs for the report as well as created the commute section of questions. This data was used by me in a term paper and by the Office of Sustainability in its greenhouse gas inventory and its Sustainability, Tracking, Assessment, and Rating System (STARS) report."

    "text": "We wake up three weeks later, Roland gets awake first and uses his energy healing Lutin and Dawnsbloom. We start wondering the halls of the healers tent until we find Ryean. We talk to Rose, she is a champion, Ryean is not happy with this development but glad she feels good that she can aid people through healing. We go to a shed and retrieve our gear when a dozen guards surround the shed.\nWe are pulled before the court of Lord Brauchuss and see his entire court, they read the letter aloud, clearing our names. With that done we head off to become registered/known mages, Selscior (still asleep) acquires a pass into the library since his is academic magic.\nWe then go shopping, buying three dozen mystery potions that make Ryean and Lutin go a little loopy. Rose informs us she needs more herbs to do her job and we go to the shanty town, mostly people from Hamiltown/Outskirts. In the town center we saw a man in the stocks, we find his friend Gesik going door to door. He expresses is understandable displeasure with the situation he is now in, they are only allowed to be in the slums or at the church.\nWe decide we will try to help the people here at least a little and spend the next day making a copious amount of bread. It turns out the town used to try and help those in need, but because of a necessary increase in funding for other things and the sharp increase of those in need, they couldn’t continue to aid people. We are able to make enough food to get everyone to last about a week on meager rations.\nWe got a summons from the former lord, Castillo, so once we were done delivering the food we headed over. We were stopped and reprimanded by a guard for not having a torch, we are too late anyways, the gate has been closed for the night, we decide to go to the inn and rest.\nIn the morning we go to meet with Castillo, as it turns out Castillo is currently talking to Lord Brauchuss, the degree to which they do not see eye to eye is audible. We head to the Spy Master’s room, we get there as Myra, the head diplomat of the court, it leaving, it would seem she has, maybe, unintentionally taking over his job. We hand over the letter from Novascosheks chambers and the stamp, he is glad to see we had the restraint to not open it.\nIt is clear in our discussion that he is not pleased with the leadership of Norgrain or Borgeniss. Roland starts digging for information about Castillo. It turns out he has two brothers, one of them died, the other became a monk, had a family and his son, Brauchuss became the lord. When pushed the Spy Master claims he is under a strict oath not to discuss the removal of Castillo or installment of Brauchuss.\nWe head to Castillo’s room as Brauchuss exits, he demands we bow to him, we do so. It would appear the former lord was something of a hunter with his office walls lined with game trophies and floor covered with skins. He is also very busy for a former lord, after a rather brief conversation we are on our way to Fort Dauss.\nWe stop to talk to Rose whom we found out is also a champion in this Game of the Gods, Ryean is not thrilled, she asks us to collect some herbs for the upcoming siege.\nOn our way north to Fort Dauss we notice that some of the scarecrows shift every once in a while, we approach two. We talk to them, turns out these scarecrows are respectable mimics just trying to make a living.\nWe also stop everyone once in a while to pick herbs until we reach the forest. We start to hear in the distance quite whelps and whimpering, it gradually gets louder, we decide to investigate. It turns out to be a wolf pup entangled in vines, Lutin carefully unties the pup and heals it, we also get some bellalichen.\nWe finally get to Fort Dauss, Sir Balbaroy is on the parapets and calls out to us, says he’s sending a detachment of cavalry to us. The entire party feels something is off, Roland crits and senses he is being insincere. We call out to him that the cavalry really aren’t necessary and he calls them off and while they are turning we also turn heading away from Fort Dauss as fast as possible.\nAfter a very fun chase sequence where we lit stuff on fire, threw out boxes and barrels, conjured fog, etc. we escape and force march through the night back to Norgrain. It would seem Balbaroy is working with Ratheious and Ledenfoul. Upon discussion Verious decides we will actively seek to be less suspicious of us and says we should head to the druid Mae wrote of."

    "text": "I apologize for this update, it has been two months since this session and I did not seem to have taken any notes opting to be a more active member of the party.\nWe began a combat with the champion, he called two or three chimeras into the room. We dispatched the chimeras fairly quickly and dealt a fair amount of damage to the champion, he teleported near a hallway to another tent and run down the hallway.\nIn that tent we fought puppets, cutting their strings, and once again did some damage to him. We fought him again in a different tent until finally in the third tent he went supernova. He took to the air making it rather difficult to deal damage until Roland commanded him to fall. When we finally dispatched him we all passed out and saw a flashback of his."

    "text": "A Restful Sleep\nThe session began with Dawn watching Qolbis, Goddess of the Sea, arguing with Myrtle. She is accusing Myrtle of unfairly interfering with game of the gods. They tentatively agree to keep their cooperation and Dawn’s being part of the party secret. We also find out that fairies are the servants of Myrtle which were mostly wiped out.\nShelter\nWhen we wake we start to head south during which we lose our way and run into a curious tree. As it turns out this is the house of three haflings, Peter, Roger, and Duff, they had been chased out of Levenfoul because they supposedly cheated while gambling. They have setup shop in this three which has been partially hollowed and filled with the small carvings. They inform us that they buried their winnings somewhere in the forest and they have no need for it, they also point us in the correct direction.\nThe trip southward is soured somewhat when it starts storming heavily, we decide to take a break and seek shelter in a cave. In the cave is a small stream and a pond. While we get a fire going we start to hear a faint knocking and Lutin starts looking around the cave. He is able to find some faint etchings in the rock face, Lutin and Ryean use their dwarven abilities to identify that the door is slate, different from the rest of the cave. Ryean gets his war hammer out and knocks the door down, we enter leaving the cracked Artur behind.\nThe Entrance\nIn the inside is a large marble statue of a knight with a shield, his head looking towards the ground. At the base of the statue are offerings, in the corner is a small kobold wearing a skull helmet wielding a femur, his name is Knots. The base of the statue also has a plaque which seems to be in primordial and among the offerings are papers in celestial, deep speech, and infernal. After we read a letter in celestial we catch the word “steadfast” and say it at the door which opens up. As we make our way down we make sure to get rubbings of the etched runes.\nWhen the door lowers Knots down down the hallway, the walls of which are covered by a mural depicting the arrival of the Wardens. We also we the insignia of the Wardens\nThe Iron Crown\nThe party enters a room in the center of which is a table with an ancient feast laid out and a skeleton at the end of the table wearing an iron crown, it lifts its goblets to us. We approach the skeleton and the wall panels open up with draugr stepping out, Ryean and Lutin to the north of the table, Selcior and Roland to the south and Dawn to the West. Roland is able to turn the three closest draugr, functionally removing them from the combat and wraps around the Eastern edge of the table passing the Skeleton.\nWith Ryean, Lutin, and Roland up close bashing away, Selcior aiding our attacks, and Dawn spell slinging we make short work of the three draugr to the north. Roland heads towards the south, the Skeleton looks towards Roland and says something in primordial, to start on the draugr over there and yells for Selcior to remove the Iron Crown from the head of the Skeleton. Selcior is able to remove the Iron Crown using mage hand placing it in his bag and succeeds in his DM roll, Selscior receives the Game Masters Crown and the Skeleton falls apart.\nWith that we quickly dispatch the remaining draugr and lift the cover of a particularly ornate looking dish, under which is Bread of Life Ryean consumes it. We do a brief search of the room, getting a rubbing of the doorway, we collect 100 gold pieces and Roland grabs a pauldron of one of the Draugr.\nBetween a rock and a wet place\nIn the next room are two massive stone blocks, an exit, and a turn crank in the center of the room. Ryean, Roland, and Lutin take up positions and start twisting the crank. Roland gets a natural 20 for strength lifting the blocks. Ryean then gets a natural 20 on constitution for keeping our progress, the blocks start to rise open the door, and water starts pouring from the ceiling so Knots, Dawn, and Selcior depart. Lutin rolls a natural 20 for turning the crank.\nWith that Roland and Lutin dive away from the crank getting bellow the door for which Ryean rolls another natural 20 for constitution holding the blocks and door in position. Roland and Lutin hold the door for Ryean to dive through. Roland leaps out from the door early and Ryean leaps in holding the door up. Both Ryean and Lutin are able to jump out at the same time.\nLight Weaponry\nThe hallway is lined with torches and splits part of the way, we head left. That room is partially filled with water and a raised track, on the far end is a tree. Lutin grabs a lance and jumps across to the track and a horse appears and the Treant animates. Lutin wins one bout and loses the other, same with Roland. Ryean is able to knock the Treant into the water. We make our way across the room to the iron gate which opens for us.\nWe enter an armory, the weapons are entirely decayed, we find ten gold pieces each, and a chest in the back. The party doesn’t have a key so says “steadfast” which pops the chest open. Lutin reaches in and grabs a buckler he hands it to Roland and it turns into a heater. Along the top of the shield is primordial script and the insignia of the Wardens in the center.\nIn the next room we find Knots, who went right. There are six pillar, three on each side and facing us is a suit of armor. Knots pokes The armor which doesn’t respond, we say “steadfast” and the armor instantly slices through Knots. Roland rushes to Knots pouring some health from his pool to Knots and initiative is rolled. Selscior forces it to flee from him and Roland gets 33 points of damage from the attack of opportunity. Between the five of us, we defeat it with relative ease.\nThe Sepulcher\nThrough the doorway lies a sarcophagus which we pivot open, on the inside are the remains of Sir Claudius. He is clutching a silver pendant and a stone slab which has a quadrant of the Wardens Tenants. After asking for permission, to which we get a response, we grab the silver pendant and stones. The Amulet of Sir Claudius and Gemstones of Power to the Mighty Caliburn, an ancient sword of great power.\nWe shift the sarcophagus and everyone except Roland go down a flight of stairs at the bottom of which is a gemstone. The gemstone is restrained by four chains, Lutin slashes through them, each time causing the earth to shake in fear. Once free the gemstone flies into Butcher, Lutin’s blade, which adds a hook.\nWe exit the Tomb of Sir Claudius and find a pile of trinkets and a note from Knots. We follow his directions and run into a camp with Trevor and a female ranger, also from the last game of the gods. She warns us against the Wardens, they fell to their own folly, bringing the evil of the old world here.\nWe reach the edge of the forest, to the east of a massive camp with a short wooden wall, to the west is the town Simpletus. We head to the town which has a massive circus tent, two inns Selcior, Dawn, and Roland head to Sylvian Lullaby, Ryean and Lutin head to Rocken-stone."

    "text": "I, Roland, was not at the beginning of the session due to a schedule conflict. When Ryean woke up he immediately left to retrieve his fathers hammer. A new player character was introduced, a fairy spell caster. Selscior and I were in a deep slumber after the events of the past day and a half.\nMess Hall\nWhen Roland wakes he goes to the gates and attempts to leave to grab Ryean’s hammer. There he learns he needs permission from the guard captain and an escort, it does not matter since he is informed the hammer had been retrieved. Roland also hears of an elderly knight that has been living in the fort and doing chores for sometime now and that Roland should meet this man, Guntz.\nThen Roland makes his way to the mess-hall, Ryean pushes past him apparently grabbing herbs to make the fort’s food worth eating. He starts placing food on his plate and spots Lutin stuffing his face full of different meats with tears of joy rolling down his face. Roland is almost done with his food when a massive figure exits the stairs and leaves the hall, matching the description of Guntz. He follows the man and sees this strange creature using his tongue to eat.\nThe Paladins\nRoland inquires the create as to if it is this Guntz fellow. The creature responds in the affirmative and when prompted tells Roland of an ancient order of knights that has long since died out. This order was named The Warden’s which fled to Ostergaia, after a great evil took power, from their native homeland. The order continued to fight evil in the Great War but their King died. Without a leader they gradually separated, died, and passed into myth. The great paladins were buried under cairns, in sepulchers, tombs, and shallow graves. They were buried with The Tenant’s, artifacts wielded by the Wardens, only when recombined will the order be reformed.\nWe spent the next few days training with our respective mentors and gained feats. During this time the captain of the guard from Daus was scouting and investigating Hamiltown.\nAccusations\nThe captain, Verios, returned after several days with news that outskirts village was intact and the city was in perfect condition but everyone was missing. Verios accused us of being spies. He says that the villagers claimed the townsfolk attacked the village. Verios slipped and said that the villagers were human, something that should have been obviously fishy. He continued to press us until the Lord of Fort Daus stepped in and stopped Verios.\nAfter some discussion we decided that we would head to the outskirts village the next day with Mae, a scout from Daus. Verios would hunt down the invaders. Mae would keep an eye on us and be the official reporter for the mission once we returned. Once this plan was set, Roland started to ponder all that he knew and formed a theory. Roland went to the Lord of the Fort and asked about Verios. The Lord was apologetic for Verios’ behavior and said that Verios has challenged his leadership of the Fort."

    "text": "We arrive in Norgrain fully rested and head to the general store manager. He gives us 350 gold pieces in all. We then head back to the house to investigate the pie Rose made for us. The pie has eight slices, when administered they will take a downed character up to half health. We decide to go to sleep, during the night Dawnsbloom misty steps into Lutin’s room and drops onto his stomach then misty steps away. We then wake up to Dawn making an absolutely exquisite breakfast. She critted for stealth when messing with Lutin then again on breakfast, 10/10 bit.\nDuring breakfast we hear a knocking at the door which Dawnsbloom answers. It is Father Varilio, she promptly closes the door and calls for Lutin who ran upstairs and is diving out the window. Ryean goes to the door and talks to Father Varilio, it would seem Varilio just missed Lutin. Varilio has gotten some more powerful worshipers together to retry the exorcism. If Lutin continues on the path he may be branded a heretic and if we help in it would extend to us.\nWith that somewhat ominous conversation out of the way we head to the Healer Shanty to grab Rose. When we ask for her there is some consternation but she insists that her mission will allow her to be considerably more useful. She has heard of an Ursagul terrorizing the country side, in the lair of the beast should be some special mushrooms. Before we leave a make a quick stop at Tristrums to get the sheath altered. Apparently Lord Brauchuss is going west for negotiations and needs fine clothes, but he will make room for us.\nA Bear of a Job\nWe head out towards Merryduke Farm and find the trail of the Ursagul. The trail leads to the north west, Merryduke manages most of the farmland surrounding Norgrain. We find them in their barn pouring over maps, almanacs, and botany books trying to figure what weather resistant crops to grow. They don’t have much information mainly they have a wolf issue and we should talk to their friend Furgus. On the way to the house we find a geyser that has been turned into a sauna and choose to relax for a bit. When we get to his house we see a dragon born wearing a straw hat in a rocking chair. It is somewhat clear he has been trying to keep an eye out but fell asleep.\nAfter waking up, he leads us down the trail of ruin to get to the . We all circle up and start trying to help Ryan work on his rizz. While we are doing this, Rose continued on and we don’t see her. So we spend the next few minutes running around loony-tunes style until we get everyone back together. When we finally make it to his farm we see three of his seven bee huts have been destroyed.\nWe continue on our way and find the Ursagul fairly quickly. A turn or two into the combat five wolves appear, one of them got two crits on Dawn… ouch! Lutin does the killing blow on the Ursagul to which Rose freaks out because it would have been easier to follow it to its lair. Lutin tracks the trail back to the cave which takes about an hour. Selscior also gets the raven back and walks away from us (it has a letter and ten gold). Rose is able to carefully retrieve the mushrooms and we head back to Norgrain.\nDanger Will Robinson\nOn the way back to the wagon we see seven people traveling parallel to us. We intersect them and as it turns out it is Boar Mask guy and six of his pals. He tells his friends to finish their job and they depart. We talk to him for a while. We find out that he only became a champion during the raid on Hamiltown. He also keeps saying “she should be here soon”, the “she” as it turns out is the monk from the last game. She appears and it would see she and Qolbis have a score to settle with Lutin"

    "text": "We begin the session by tying Balbaroy up and heading out to find Various. Once the commanders were occupied by us, the assault of the fort did not take very long. Making our way through the fort we see Dauss knights laying down their arms surrendering. After a brief conversation with Various we loot Eric and Tywin. From the parapets we see a large force on the edge of the forest, it turns around and heads out. Various says he is staying here to rebuild, he lends us Guntz as an escort and we head back to Norgrain with Balbaroy.\nOn the way back we talk to Balbaroy a little bit, he is apparently from Ratheious, he expects to be killed. Some time into our trip we hear someone say “that’s not right” then a very loud pop. We decide to leave Guntz with Balbaroy and go towards the sound, once we are there all we find is a pack, a book, and a messed up spell circle. The book is titled “Spells for Dummies” and Selscior can tell fairly easily that none of the spells in it would function correctly.\nWe continue on our way and have a brief conversation with Guntz. He is impressed that we have been able to find and make it through several Warden tombs. Apparently he knows the location of one to the north but was never able to open it. We decide that next Warden tomb will be that one and we will bring Guntz with us.\nWe are in the farms surrounding Norgrain when we stop to pick some hexseed. Not far away from where we stop we see a section of blighted grain. We find the closest farmers and suggest that they harvest as soon as possible and let the others know.\nPlanning in Norgrain\nWhen we make it back we are able to find Castillo, Brauchuss is unavailable at the moment. We find out that Oswald has his spying ring up and running. Roland has a brief exchange with Castillo where he says that ambition killed his reign. He also adds that it the other lords were not wrong to seek his removal. Castillo decides it is well past time that we get properly rewarded by Norgrain. In conversation he proposes a few properties and floats the idea of rebuilding Hamiltown, he also upgrades our cart giving us a banner of Norgrain as well. After some discussion we decide that we would love to rebuild Hamiltown; however, winter is on its way so we should wait a little bit. We conclude that we will take a property in Norgrain.\nThe party breaks up at this point to get some individual stuff out of the way. Selscior and Dawn go to the library to sell the Hearthstone, it is worth 250 gold pieces. Selscior is also offered acceptence into the college, first he pays Castillo a visit asking about the joining the spy ring. He is directed to meet with Oswald and after going to Oswald’s office he joins the spy ring. He opts not to let any of us know.\nRoland, Ryean, and Lutin go to the brawling pit for some hand to hand pvp, very fun. In the last round Ryean faces an npc and they go back and forth grappling each other, quite funny. At last we meet back up and select a few quests to do in the coming days. We talk to Casandra, a centaur that is headed out to Fort Dauss to help train the garrison, we help her pack. Finally we head to our house to figure out sleeping arrangements. Dawn in the attic, Ryean and Lutin get rooms, then Selscior and Roland get places in the living room.\nButch Hits the Fan\nLutin talks to Butch who shows him the strings tying us to the gods. Lutin slices his own string, separating himself from his deity patrons. He then heads downstairs and does the same for Selscior then Roland. Each have a brief interaction with Butch before accepting his ultimatum. He ends with Ryean who has an extended conversation with Butch before accepting the deal.\nDawn is pulled into a dream and sees the Pantheon of Ostergaia in an uproar. The gods decide to execute Myrtle for her interference in the game. Dawnsbloom starts to react when Myrtle teleports her away. The session ends with Myrtle being executed."

This entrance seemed to have been sealed for quite some time as there are no offerings. After reading a piece of writing we determine that the keyword is “loyal”. Once we open the door, we enter the hallway in which is a mural depicting the King of the Wardens surrounded by his men.\nThe dining room has a single chalice and several suits of armor along the wall. Inside the chalice is a reddish purple liquid which Lutin drinks as combat begins. After defeating the suits we move into the next room in which there is a chain that when Ryean pulls starts to open a seem in the wall. Dripping down the chain is an acidic liquid that gradually starts hurting Ryean. We head into the opening in the wall, there are two jumps onto rolling cylinders. On the other side of the gap is a platform with four bowls. We deduce that four of us must make it across to solve the puzzle and get through. Roland has considerable trouble with this task, falling several times. Eventually we are able to get onto the platform and move into the next section.\nSir Kirin\nThis hallway splits two ways, one to the right labeled “shrine” and to the left “grave”. We decide to go to the shrine first. An ent blocks the way to the shrine and says, “You must match the wit of Sir Kirin in his favorite pastime, riddles.” We must solve four of the five riddles, we get all five. On the inside there are a few magic items and Selscior takes the time to cast find familiar.\nWe then head towards the grave, guarding it is another suit of armor. Dawnsbloom recreates the pose of the statue of Sir Kirin, the suit of armor takes her dart and steps aside. In Sir Kirin’s tomb is another Tenant, the Tenant of Loyalty, he has an insignia ring, and the pommel of Caliburn. Lutin pushes the sepulcher to the side and descends into a small room. The rest of the party shares concerned looks and descends after him. Ryean restrains him, Roland steps between Lutin and the gemstone. Selscior tries to use his familiar but it is destroyed by Lutin. Ryean starts carrying Lutin up the stairs before Butch blasts us all away and cuts the chains away. It is clear to us that Butch had been possessing Lutin.\nQuite Travels\nWe quietly head back towards Norgrain, we find nine patches of Bellalichen. Then we run into a very drunk Trevor who then gets Lutin and Dawnsbloom very drunk. We are almost back when we stop the cart to collect four more reaper weeds and hear in our minds a “ribbet” after stopping the cart we have a brief talk with a massive toad Garganell. We finish the session back in Norgrain, it is clear tonight will be mostly restless."

    "text": "After our nightmares we wake up and head over to the Bailiff. On our way we see that the friend of Gesik is no longer in the stocks. We also notice that the beggers are inching closer to market square, we each give out nine gold, though money is not the primary issue. Apparently even Castillo ventured out here and talked to Gesik. The main issue now is shelter, while out we need to find a lumber mill and get lumber. During the conversation, Lutin sees the orc group from Outskirts, they are missing a member.\nWe continue on our way to the Bailiffs quarters and knock on the door, waking him up. When he finally opens the door we just say we’re headed for the forest and start walking away. Selscior requests we get the Game Masters Crown identified further so we head for the church. We talk to Father Varilio, he tells us to seek out Tristram, he is a tailor that trained at the college and worked on magical thread.\nApparently such crowns were somewhat common at parties, the magic can be somewhat altered depending on the situation. While you can direct the enchantment, generally letting the magic chose its form will wield the strongest results. This does come at the obvious risk of not knowing what the enchantment will be. Such magical artifacts are quite common among bards, loosening their tongues allowing for wittier responses. Selscior decides to go the quick and dirt route allowing Tristram to let the magic snap to whatever form it may. We offer Tristram gold but he refuses, saying the opportunity to work on such an artifact makes up for any cost. He does sell several of us on infinitely repairing, always fitting clothes made of magical thread, fifteen gold each.\nEncounters of the Fifth Kind\nWith our business in town at a conclusion we headed to the cart and left town. On our way we see a large stone building, it would seem Norgrain is in the midst of training up its garrison. We also see a butcher’s shop run by a Firbolg, it is a very clean operation. The Firbolg bemoans the response people generally have towards butchers “Go into a town with a butchers blade and everyone thinks you’re crazy.” Lutin gets a few chunks of warthog and a meat sack. Next we run into a group of fisherman, we stop and try our hand at catching a massive catfish though none of us succeed. Lutin attempted to use eldritch bolt with help, a 2 then a 3, he then used his inspiration and rolled another 3. Dawn does win a rock throwing contest and gets some gold.\nAs we continue on our way we collected five bellalichen. We run into a pond with the monk from the previous Game of the Gods meditating on a rock in the center. There is a storm brewing, the waves of the pond seem to be in sync with her heartbeat. We decide it is best to leave her and her gear (near a shrine to Qolbis) alone.\nAt last we enter the basin Rose spoke of, we can hear the cries of Weeper-reeds. There is a small stream with a bridge running across it at the mouth of which is a group of goblins. The goblins are dancing around a central figure distinctively dressed. When we approach, the goblins secret service style push the figure to the back of the pack. During our conversation we notice they are generally fixated on us and not the cart so Dawn gets the cart rolling. Selscior gets what Dawn is doing and gets out his flute and gets a 29 in performance with Ryean joining in a dance. Lutin notices the stream is really small and literally walks across it not using the bridge. We realize the bridge is just here and does absolutely nothing so we also step across it. The goblins, dejected, saunter off, the leader casting his distinctive clothes aside. We are able to collect five Wheeper-reeds.\nThe Full Moon\nWe decide to rest for the night. Lutin gives Roland the fish from his bag, I roll at dirty 20 on filleting them, I’m able to collect a vial of fish oil. Dawn decides to take solo watch throughout the night. As the night wears on a figure appeared from the shadows magically putting Dawn to sleep, though Dawn can see through the dream somewhat. She sees a small figure laying in a pool of water crying.\nThe entire party fails our wisdom rolls. Lutin is able to pull Butch out and strikes out at the inky moon. We wake up, Lutin sees his blade is wet with blood, he casts hex on the figure, we roll initiative. She summons two shadow figures and an incredibly intense battle occurred. Roland was downed twice, Lutin and Selscior once each, even Ryean was reduced well below half before getting healed. We finally defeated her, a cloak, her body. Our respective primary weapon become moontouched.\nWhen she is defeated she turns into her true form, a small tiefling child, neck snapped. Ryean, who dealt the final blow, storms into the forest, yells at the moon, Zephene appears, he has a tense conversation with her. Zephene was created by the Wardens, forced into godhood somehow. Zephene is a tired god and wishes to be done, we will seek the conclusion of Zephene. Lutin calls out to Butch but a new voice answers. This new voice is the added gem, a separate aspect of Butch. It claims there were two gods, one of them was split apart and cast about the world, this is Butch. Lutin believes the other was similarly split up, but instead infused into the life of Ostergaia."

I grew up helping my dad machine lumber with the jointer planer and jointer; cutting boards down to final dimensions with the table, miter, or radial arm saws; and finishing with rabits, pockets, etc… In high school I made a truly terrible Tak, of Wise Man Fears fame, game board and during the winter of 2022, I made several dice trays for the Clash of Crowns crew. More recently, I made an overly complex (yet not complex enough, I have ideas for a mark two) coffee bar shelf as well as a bookshelf. Currently I have been trying to work on incorporating metal and CNC work into my woodworking projects. I am hoping to construct another bookshelf just for my Mass Media Paperback collection of R.A. Salvatore’s Drizzt Saga, currently upto the Starlight Enclave, waiting for the newer books to be released in MMP. The idea is for this new shelf to be the exact height of the books and just wide enough to fit each row of books in slightly less than snuggly and for each book to have a button below it so that when pressed, the book is pushed forward to be grabbed, I know I know, a very worthwhile project… like I said, this is what I like to do on break, think of a silly idea, do my best to execute, and be pleasantly surprised when the result it actually quite nice and I still have all my fingers."

    "text": "We began the session with each player introducing their character and then having a one-on-one interaction with the festival before the group began to assemble.\nThe first character, Ryean, a dwarf baker opened the session in his bakery getting the last few loaves ready for the festival. Next was Roland, a half-orc fishmonger, who while on his way to Hamiltown from the Outskirts Village saw children making model ships. Following Roland was Selscior a half-elf entertainer who played a carnival game or two. Finally was Lutin, a dwarf butcher, he started in the shop with his father before going out to the festival to play games.\nFollowing the initial introductions Ryean went around the festival as an OSHA of sorts, trying to make the games safer, meanwhile the characters one by one joined him. We played a few games together, including a fairly quick game during which Roland won a feather of pure gold. Roland intends to make the obviously magical feather a necklace to keep rather than to use.\nThe Plot Thickens\nDuring one of the games Roland and Selscior spotted three people sneaking into the moat around the lords castle. Roland and Selscior overhear the men talking about how they will use the sewage tunnels as an escape route. The to be Paladin and Bard enter the moat and question the men who say they are there to clean the moat. While this seems semi-plausible and perhaps they misheard, but earlier Ryean had mentioned the cleaning of the sewage tunnels/moat happens annually. They also reason that the cleaning would happen before the festival, not during. So, the two decide to bring it to Ryean’s attention, after a brief discussion they inform the bailiff.\nWith that issue dealt with the party resumes the games. Following a particularly ruckus game involving a water mill, the party went back into the village for to finish a few small tasks. Roland stand there in the middle of the village, a place he normally is not comfortable being and swells with pride and determination. The leader of Selscior’s group expresses his desire that Selscior leave the group for a time and discover the world himself. Lutin goes to the church and discusses ways to solve his meat allergy and hashes his bet, going with all three.\nThe group reassembles and joins a growing crowd, the final event is about to happen. The entire village gets in a line and in groups of four places a sacrifice of sorts in the fire. The party is called forward and one by one they place an object in the fire. Ryean places a loaf of bread, Newt places a piece of meat, Selscior places SOMETHING, and finally Roland places his quarter staff. A massive cloud envelopes the group and they are transported in front of sixteen very angry gods. Myrtle has selected us four as her champions, it is us four that the future will pivot upon.\nTime to Run\nThe four of us come back, no time has passed, we remove ourselves and briefly discuss what this means. Before we know it we are thrown into a massive parade going around the town. A man is spotted on a hill, his shadow thrown in the evening light. He is wearing a horned helmet with a sword in one hand and a pick-axe in the other. He commands his emerging force to charge the village. The group splits, Ryean running for his house. Selscior into a random house to loot, Newt to his house, and Roland stays outside.\nRyean starts shouting for his brother and father to quickly get outside. Ryean starts gathering things, he doesn’t hear anyone moving so goes into his fathers room. Over his father Ryean sees his brother weeping, on the bedside table is a half empty bottle. Ryean grabs his brother and gets him out while questioning him.\nSelscior quickly discovers he is in Rose’s house and gets Rose and her grandmother out of the house. Lutin enters his house to see his father gearing up and Lutin grabs his meat cleaver. Everyone exits the houses and start running for the sewage tunnels in the moat they learned about earlier that day.\nWhen they enter the moat they spot the Bailiff face down in the muck, one by one the group and villagers slide down the tunnel. Ryean runs to hold the hatch open for Grandma, Rose, Selscior, then Lutin. Lutin’s father stands by the Bailiffs body readying his final stand, Roland decides to stand with Lutin’s father and goes for the Bailiffs sword. When Roland reaches down he discovers the Bailiff if alive, if only just and the mission instantly changes. Roland hoists the Bailiff across his back and dashes for the hatch. Lutin’s father runs the other way dragging the enemy attention.\nTo be Heroes\nWhen the party exits the other side of the tunnel they discover the three ruffians. There the characters when pressed to the edge gain their levels. After everything they have gone through this day, they will not accept their fate. They gain three levels, Ryean rushes in and starts hacking at a ruffian. Lutin enters the fray bisecting one of the men. Selscior attacks one and Roland positions himself to protect the civilians and restores the Bailiff. Ryean kills the ruffian and the third is quickly knocked out. The party reigns in three horses from the nearby stables. We then prop the ruffians bodies up and slap the horses in a different direction. The group now heads to the forest towards Fort Daus.\nThe party decides to lead a forced march to the fort hoping to out pace and out distance the invading savages. They spot a man they believe to be Lutin’s father being dragged behind a horse back towards the village. Rose’s grandmother starts to tire quickly and the party starts taking shifts carrying her. There are a few scares but by the morning the group can see Fort Daus. They decide they will try to sneak but the enemy spot them, the chase is on.\nAn advance group of three cavalry start chasing them quickly closing the gab. Roland manages to should the grandmother for sixty feet. Ryean throws his fathers hammer dismounting one of the cavalry. Selscior guides the civilians and Lutin engages another of the cavalry. Roland manages to place the grandmother on the horse of the dismounted soldier and is able to guide it to the fort in short order followed by other civilians and Selscior. Lutin and Ryean continue to slow the cavalry but get caught in a volley from the fort. After another exchange of blows including Lutin bisecting another man the forts cavalry ride out to meet the enemy with Ryean and Lutin safely getting into the fort.\nOnce in the fort Ryean retells the previous days events to the captain of the guard at the fort. Roland mentions the commanding officer who was so confident he didn’t even bother joining the fray. During their forced march to the Fort the group spotted others running to the forest for refuge and some even running to the mines. Ryean talks to Rose about his actions the past few hours and Ryean confronts Lutin on his murderous actions. During the night Lutin has three dreams, one for each of his benefactors. Roland leaves the fort early in the morning to try and find Ryean’s hammer."

    "text": "In this wild garden Dawn starts to wonder, the rest of the party follows, we find an ent, Pinochle. In conversation Pinochle states there is something off about the new goods. Apparently Dawnsbloom is the only fairy in existence and the first in 500 years. Apparently Laxaldir, the ents, and fairies were the first beings in existence. When Myrtle and Ieyagi came into existence they merely became the care givers of nature and plants which predated them.\nWithin this wild garden was once a great tree, only three seeds from which exist, Pinochle gives us one to aid the people of Norgrain. She also informs us of a petrified ent within Bleakwoods, once of the single oldest entities in existence. We also find out that the Wardens were fighting off a demonic invasion. She than informs us that Mae was here a short two weeks prior, she was done with her hunt and perhaps became the prey. The Great Trees are not merely the sacred dwellings of the elves, the elves inhabited the great trees in order to serve as protectors.\nWe head to Pinochle’s house which has a 150 tall door, she takes Dawn for a walk, they see Myrtle and Ieyagi. Pinochle informs Dawn that Ieyagi and Myrtle, while not as old as the two creator beings, are older than the rest of the gods. However, the nature beings worked for an entity before Myrtle and Ieyagi became their caregivers.\nWe go to sleep and head off in the morning. Before we leave Pinochle informs us that she is uncertain about the value of Ieyagi’s neutrality in this competition. If need be, she would rather have us destroy her and take her boon than another god’s champion.\nFar Stone Mine\nWe take our leave and head to the Far Stone Mine,. On our way we run into a bard, his lute only has two strings. We attempt to restring the lute and have him play, it is not good, and we are not good at lying about it. The foreman tells us that his five miners went down a few days ago and haven’t resurfaced. We get four mine carts and go flying down the mine shaft, it is effectively a roller coaster. We reach a three way split in the tunnel. One is for iron, another for gold, and finally a tunnel for hearthstone, we head down the hearthstone tunnel.\nOn our way down the tunnel we come across several derailed mine carts , we get out and start walking. We send Dawn ahead and she sees in the room at the end of the tunnel. In the room there is a dead dwarf, a mage with a red stone, several lizard folk, a troll, and a zombie. The dwarves Scott, Eugine, Derrick, and Gunther are in the corner crying out for their lost comrade Carl.\nWe begin the combat which is a ton of fun. It becomes considerably easier once Dawn is able to free the dwarves. Once they are out they tunnel into the wall and once a turn we are able to call one of them in to perform a lair action. Long story short, it was yet another incredibly fun combat.\nAt the end of the battle the mine starts to collapse in, we grab the largely spent hearthstone the mage was using and a few other things. We start a fairly short chase scene with the dwarves mining, we get a hearthstone and some gold. We finally end the chase and the session when the dwarves mine into a room with a marble statue of a knight kneeling with its head bowed."

    "text": "Lutin and Ryan have a private conversation. Dawn, Ryean, Selscior, and Roland all have a private meeting and decide to plan to have a plan. Ryan talks to Zephene, apparently the gods are merely of this continent, other continents, worlds, etc… have their own gods. Dawn has a meeting with Myrtle, apparently she is going to be on a vacation of sorts in a bit, Dawn is also told she had an entire other life forgotten from before she volunteered to help Myrtle. Lutin also has a discussion with the new aspect of Butch, which now does bleeding damage.\nWhen we all wake up after the very busy night, we head to Tristrum who just finished Selsciors ring, which is now one heck of an item, and Lutin receives his clothes. We head to the church and see Varilio talking to Chalbert, the crusading son of Novascoshek who is apparently headed back south. Lutin wants to see if Varilio can perform an exorcism to separate Lutin from Butch. It takes many priests but they are succeeding when Lutin intentionally destroys the ritual circle and Butch blasts them all, knocking them out. Roland goes to a shop to grab ten gold pieces worth of herbs to give Selscior to recast Find Familiar.\nThe Siege\nOnce we wrap up everything in town we head out to the siege. On our way we run into a centaur in full gear, apparently he is from the Faltenlands, Selscior points him in the very general direction. We then run into a group of witch hunters, people take the spell casting registry very seriously. Finally, before arriving we find some hexseed.\nOnce at the siege we talk to Various, either we can be part of the main force, or sneak our way in and take out the commanders. With the aid of four ghillie mantels that increase our stealth a great deal, we decide to sneak in. We also finally decide to call upon Qolbis for that storm we have been holding onto.\nTo sneak in we need to circle the fort and enter a trap door that is in the middle of the clearing surrounding the fort. We use our mantels to sneak to the door and not get detected by two archers. Roland takes a hit or two when one of them spots something is off. We descend into the tunnel and make our way into the jail where we break prisoners out and gear Guntz. Next we head to the smithy where we find more locked up people. It would seem Ryean’s brother joined them and left for Ratheious. We then have a very exciting fight. I played Roland and Guntz, we had the opportunity to dodge lightning strikes, and they were generally powerful.\nWe ended the session with Tywin (swordmaster) killed by us, Eric (archer) dead, and a defeated Balbaroy."

After a fairly extensive conversation Rose says she will not interfere with fights with other champions. She also lets us know she has a job for us. We decide we will do the Grey Keep job first so head to the Bailiffs Quarters. We all knock on the door and he chooses to slide the contract under the door. With contract in hand we head to the shop and get the cargo train moving to Fort Dauss.\nOn Guard\nAlong the way, Lutin notices that one of the fields has a pattern to it. Once we are aware of it, it is obvious, the field has been shaped in the symbol of Kyios. In the middle of the field is a shrine, we continue on our way and see even more blight than yesterday. Later a tornado of leaves hits Dawn who follows it to a small garden of herbs, five of each.\nAbout halfway to Fort Dauss Lutin spots a snare head in the road, we stop to disarm it. When we stop bandits start pouring out of the surrounding brambles, they are Carrion Crows. After a fairly quick combat, ending with Lutin executing a captured bandit, Lutin’s father steps from the bushes. A very intense conversation takes place. It would seem that he has some connection to the Wardens and that is why he had Butch. He tells Lutin that the next time we go to a tomb he should see what his blood does, whatever that means. He departs after effectively promising the next time they meet only one of them will be walking away. Ryean also extorts some money from Casandra for not joining the fight and being out of practice. When we reach Fort Dauss it is clear they have been hard at work overnight. We talk to Various who gives us fifteen gold pieces each.\nDirty Business\nWe then decide to do the quest for a merchant in Norgrain. The post said a wagon had left Ratheios but didn’t arrive, it has something of his. He does not specify; however, it will apparently be clear what it is. We head towards Ratheios for some time. On our way we run into a mercenary that has been hard at work. We find the wagon tipped over and tracks headed North of North East. Following the tracks we find a dead tree that has many people hanging from it. There is a sign in primordial that reads “As always to our oppressors”. The people have symbols of both Norgrain and Ratheios, some even have the mark of the Wardens. Selscior draws the scene sending a raven back to Norgrain with the sketch.\nThe trail ends at a set of ruined stone buildings. Selscior uses his familiar to scout the rubble finding a small troupe around a fire. After talking we devise a plan, Selscior and Dawn will hang out of sight while Ryean, Roland, and Lutin barge in. Ryean breaks through the wall entering the camp followed by lutin and a ducking Roland. The people offer us a place to sleep, they seem quite nice, we strike up conversation. Dawn goes invisible, spots the lock box, sneaks into it, loots it, and misty steps back to Selscior who messages the group. Roland stands up and acts as if he just remembered he left the stove on in Norgrain, they really should be headed back asap. As it turns out Dawn stole everything, not just the pink glowing Hearthstone so we book it out of there.\nOn our way back we decide we are somewhat curious about the fight that happened. We follow the path of destructing leading south of the wagon for about an hour before we decide it probably isn’t worth it. We end the session headed back to Norgrain with our loot in hand."

    "text": "We start the session very calmly by rolling initiative. We all roll really high… Bailgar and Sarah still win the intiative. Sarah focuses on Lutin at the beginning and none of us step in to help, focusing on Bailgar. Lutin is about to drop when we start fighting Sarah. The combat was quite long, with characters going down, rolling a few death saves, getting back up, very intense and lots of fun. We end the combat with Sarah dead (killed by Sarah) and Bailgar tied up, we talk to him for a bit before leaving.\nTravel\nAfter getting our cart while heading to Fergus a pack of wolves skirts around us. They start threatening us before Jerma jumps out in front and pushes them on. One of the wolves stays hangs back a bit longer before running after the others. After talking to Fergus we start off to Maryduke Farms. While headed there we meet a merchant caravan with a detachment of knights, we start talking to Nicholas who gives us five gold each.\nNorgrain\nOnce in Norgrain we collect my plate armor, Roland’s natural AC of 21. We then stop by Tristrum to get the modified sheath and Dawns’ outfit. When we are back in our house Selscior gets out a letter from his mother (it’s not from is mother) asking us to go to Kleptins Keep, it seems like we will. Ryean has a very personal conversation with Goldmyre, Dawnsbloom talks to Myrtle who tricked all the gods into thinking she was dead. In all, it was a good session of D&D which gave everyone plenty to think about and plan over spring break."

    "text": "After a short hiatus we are back and ready to pickup where we left.\nTo Hamiltown\nWe wake up and get ready to leave for Hamiltown. Many of the guards are there to see us off and we meet Mae who will be watching/helping us. The chef even gives us each a loaf of bread as thanks for the baking tips from Ryan.\nAlong the way we meet a Satyr druid who is obviously extremely powerful and loosing grasp of reality. He gives each of us a berry with a magical random magical effect. We put together that he is from the previous group of adventurers that were selected for the Game of the Gods.\nShortly following that we ran along a stream that went to an alter to Myrtle. It was in disrepair and we did our best job of restoring it and heard her say “Steadfast”.\nThe Vultures\nAt midday we reached the forest edge. There we can see that the outskirts village is in ruins and looters are in the town. Mae is able to lead most of the looters, a gang call the vultures, away from town. Six vultures remained and we quickly handled them incapacitating the majority, killing a few.\nWe recognize one of those incapacitated missing a leg as Artur, the jokester from the water mill. Roland removes the insignias from the vultures’ cloaks as proof of the groups work. Roland also grabs a dagger and each member of the group collected ten gold pieces worth of items. Mae reappears from the forest after loosing them.\nThe Conspiracy\nWe moved onto the bailey. Ryean threw the fairy onto the parapets who then destroyed the draw bridge mechanism lowering it. The party entered, it appeared that the bailey had not been seized what-so-ever. We enter the keep and go down to the cellars, there are three cells and under a bear skin rug a tunnel. The group then went upstairs to Sir Novascoshek’s chambers.\nInstantly Roland started looking for correspondences, all he finds are standard letters. The party turns the chambers over and finds a hidden drawer with a sealed letter. Selscior being the one to find it attempts to pocket the letter, when noticed he simply reads it in the open for others to read.\nFor the explanation, I will create a separate post that contains the logic Roland is operating with. Here is the bottom line of the conspiracy. Sir Novascoshek was working with Lord Castillo and Verios to destabilize the balance of power and take control of Borgeniss. We leave the keep via the tunnel and see that Sir Novascoshek in the end stood true to his station and attempted to protect the outskirts village.\nInvestigation\nLutin finds and repairs Sir Novascoshek’s stamp and Roland takes an insignia from a knight’s cape. We then go to the moat around the keep and in the same tunnel as the pit we find the bodies of all those that died. Ryean grabs his fathers body which was towards the top. We go back to the town center to check on the people that are tied up. After a brief discussion we decide to investigate the wizards tower to the north of the town.\nWhen we arrive at the tower Lutin uses his hex blade to break the door down, Ryean and Roland share a look of concern. The party makes their way up the tower, there are no traps or monsters to slow our way. Enter a room with a telescope and a spell book in a language none of us recognize. The telescope is pointed directly at where the invaders appeared. We also find a skeleton, Matias the Mad, on the bed with a ring on one of his fingers. We identify the ring, created by a forge cleric, called “For the Wizard”. Finally we find a glass of water and a fresh apple, someone has been here very recently. Ryean tries to call out to the invisible person that may still be in the room that we are friendly but there is no response.\nWe quite quickly that is was our own stupidity that made the mage fear us and run away without any discussion. We decide it is time to bury Ryean’s father and head towards the mine to him a proper burial. When we arrive at the mine Mae says that she is claustrophobic and someone should check on the prisoners. Everyone else makes their way into the mine, we get into the tunnel, reach the elevator and descend.\nThe Foreman’s Cairn\nOnce in the mine proper Lutin starts leading the way. When we first ran from the town we saw people flee into the mine and we start making our way through mud made from their blood. Lutin decides to scout ahead and sees that a great force of undead is at the bottom of the mine. He starts to make his way back but his chainmail is too loud and the chase begins. I will get the chase rules that we used and make a separate post with the rules written out and explained.\nWe escape to the elevator, Lutin stays to turn the wench to get everyone up. Roland lowers the elevator and tried twice to get Lutin up but the wench keeps locking up. Finally Ryean pushes Roland to the side and raises the elevator, to slow down the mob Lutin thunderwaved, starting a cave in. We all start running out of the cave and Ryean drops his father, not the burial we wanted for him, but it’s the one he’ll get. We all get out moments before the mine fully collapses.\nMae\nThe party starts to make its way towards the town to meet up with Mae. When the group gets to town we see that the people are gone. Since it has been raining, we can see Mae’s foot steps leading up to where they were tied up. Leading away from that point is a trail with two sets of footprints, Mae started walking in one of their tracks. Outside of the town they diverge, both south one to the east and the other to the west. We decide to track to the south east, it looks like we wont be going back to Fort Daus anytime soon."

    "text": "A rock ‘n’ morning\nLutin is awoken bright and early by the owner of the Rock ‘n’ Stone banging on the posts of the inn. Ryean does not wake up and is tossed out of the inn. We get our bearings, we are in Simpletis, a reasonably sized town with two inns, a library, a general store, an armory, apple seller, pawn broker, and a hunters shed. As we make our way through the town we get a general eerie feeling, the southern half is abandoned.\nWe make our way to the library. The librarian is extraordinarily tired and over worked, he’s been working over time for the mayor. As it turns out this scholar can read primordial, we hand him some of our material for him to translate, he also takes the wizards tome. Dawn also starts learning primordial with his help and Selscior starts doing some research on the town. We ask the librarian about the state of the town which he had not been aware of.\nA big stick\nThe rest of us head to the Protection Emporium. While digging around we ask about any swords, apparently the owner had just sold their best sword. Months ago the former Lord of Norgrain, Castillo, bought a replica of an ancient sword, it was silver with gemstone, and had a worn inscription. The shop owner bought this sword from a merchant in the east.\nWith that information and a new weapon for Ryean we then went to the hunting shed. We learn from the owner that no one has been hunting because of bandits. Ryean is able to get a heavy crossbow, he must do a sponsor read with every shot, and Lutin gets a few bear traps.\nNot softly spoken\nWith a newly armed group we marched back to the library to pick up Dawnsbloom and Selscior. Selscior informs us that the Lord of Norgrain to the north, Brauchuss, and the Lord of Ledenfowl have started to clash. Simpletis is on the border of the two kingdoms and as such received a partial garrison from both; however, the both of them withdrew their soldiers creating a power vacuum.\nBandits started robbing merchants on their way to Simpletis, set up camp in the woods, and started abducting people from town. This has created somewhat of a crisis for the Mayor whose only option was to contract with a mercenary company. The three circus tents are a bit of an unknown, they just showed up one day and sent out tickets.\nNow that our concerns have been raised we head for the mayors manor. Outside of the manor is a quest board covered with postings for bandits and a monster to the south terrorizing a farm. When enter the manor to discuss the bounties and issues with the mayor. He is an elderly bronze dragonborn, a gentle father and grandfather that cares for the town. We are able to obtain a wagon and a team of animals. We decide to head out to the south and strike out at the monster, whatever it may be.\nAlong our path was a group of people, Selscior got a natural 20 on stealth and moved into investigate the people. It is a group of orcs, half-orcs, and dwarves half exhausted to death, they had been running for two days from Hamiltown. We tell Yurnack, a dwarf that used to farm for Novascoshek’s estate, the direction of Simpletis.\nThe bigger stick\nWe continue on our way until we run into two people tending a field, while they grow plants like other farms, they mostly make honey. The main building is a massive bee hive that has been broken into by the monster. We start fortifying the position, laying out the bear traps, and taking places to ambush the mighty beast. Roland hides in the building behind the hive boxes, Selscior makes a very convincing scarecrow, Dawn takes up the shed roof, Lutin and Ryean hide off to the side of the building. We aren’t waiting too long before the behemoth appears.\nThe beast steps on a trap and shakes it off before continuing its lurching walk towards the building. The battle is fierce, it leaves in its wake a trail of difficult terrain making it hazardous to move. It collapses half the building managing to knock Dawnsbloom down. Even with Ryean, Roland, and Lutin all striking savagely at the beast it manages to hold its ground. Every strike was somewhat muted by the fact the unnatural bear had a thick oil coating its fur which would clot its wounds.\nFinally we are able to take the monster down, only for it is dissolve into nothing leaving behind a tooth and Gauntlets of the Ursagul. Ryean picks them up and attunes to them up and we ask to sleep the night at the farm house. In the night we have a shared dream, Myrtle, Goldmir, and Qolbis inform us that we will soon face a champion of Esara, the Goddess of Love. We wake up and head to town as quickly as possible.\nShot through the heart\nWhen we get to town we see all the doors are shut tight, no one is outside, when we arrive at the manor we see the door is slightly ajar. We push our way in to see the mayor and his son pouring over a desk of papers. Many people have gone missing, while we were away the circus opened, people went in but no one has left. We resolve to go to the circus, find out what is going on, and save the mayors grandson.\nWe approach the circus tent and see a sign that says “Tickets for Administration”, as we step through our tickets burn up in our hands. We hear Myrtle tell us “Set the board” and we enter the hallway entrance, we start walking forward. We seem to be walking further and further without getting any closer to the room. Ryean turns around and starts walking backwards, hits a figure, turns around and sees an elf with a pair of massive golden wings “Welcome to the games.”"

    "text": "This was our first online session during winter break, I was somewhat late to the session and Selscior was\nWhen the party wakes we watch as the circus equipment dissolves and blows away into nothingness. The people that had been kidnapped start to wake and we start going through the crowd looking for the mayors grandson. We spot a barrel shaking slight and we start talking to the kid, he doesn’t want to leave the barrel, so Ryean crits the barrel spiting it open.\nWe walk back to the manor with Hurk, Mr. Heskin is glad to see is his grandson is alright and awards us 500 gold pieces. He also informs us the Norgrain is sending two squads of knights to help the town, they are going to throw a party for the Heroes of Hamiltown. We thank him and inform him it would we really should be on our way.\nWe head south out of Simpletis, while crossing the river we hear a voice telling us to bath the wings in the water and we all enter the river. Lutin temporarily dawns both wings. We start sinking until we are ripped out of our bodies and thrown along the river to the northwest and see a pound with a shrine of myrtle, we fall down a waterfall, and see the mouth of a cave, within the cave is the statue of a knight.\nWe regain consciousness and see the knights riding into Simpletis, since we are curious we send Dawnsbloom into eavesdrop. Various would seem to leading the contingent and tells Heskin that we are needed by Lord Brauchuss, we are skeptical and head to the cave.\nWe start to feel a great shaking of the earth then start to hear the stomps of feet and a mixture of creaking and cracking. It gets louder until we begin passing animated trees. Dawn decides she is going to be brave and talks to it, all it says is “We march west. Lush forest west. Fresh sea salt wind west.”\nAs we make our way with our wagon we come across a tree in the road, we all know whats up. We get out and start to try to clear the road when six bandits appear and attempt to intimidate us. We glance each others way, nod our heads, and chuck the tree at the charmer. He is not dead, but everyone takes a good step back, it seems like he won’t be getting up anytime soon.\nHello, this is the author here, I have made the executive decision to play the game during combats, it really doesn’t work if people aren’t thinking ahead. As such, I will have very few notes on combats.\nFrom the shadows a man wearing a tusked helmet with a pickax in his hand steps forward calling the others useless, a very cool boss fight ensues. First Roland goes down, within short order Dawn and Lutin are felled until it is just the Champion of War and Ryean standing. The Champion offers Ryean a deal, he can die heroically or the party can Rocky our ways to the top to give him a more enjoyable fight. Ryean chooses to fight another day, neither is particularly overjoyed with this.\nThe Champion leaves and Sir Various catches up to us informing us that Mae sent a letter back and we are required for the reading of it in the Lords court. Ryean makes them knock him out, it takes the two guards a good while to subdue the barbarian."

    "text": "We have found out to do jobs for the city we must notify the Bailiff before payment. The party heads over to the bailiff, we decide to deal with the cities rat problems before the siege, no one ever selects this quest so it should be interesting though it is only for thirty gold total. The bailiff is quite helpful in offering us wax plugs for our nostrils, sewers and all that. We are informed that the rats are centered our the church and Hammerhall forge.\nWe head for the church first, moving a small trap door, Ryean leaps to the sewer below, everyone else opts to climb down the ladder. Lutin casts light on Butch and Selscior scans the tunnel, keeping an eye out for anything suspicious, he mostly sees rat bones. We start to sense something is off and Lutin chucks Butch down the tunnel glimpsing a swarm of rats. Thankfully rats are not the most observant and we are able to get the jump on them.\nThe rats spread out, one bites Roland manages of paralyze him for several rounds, large bats also join the fray. After a surprisingly damaging battle, both Roland and Lutin dropping below half. We surface back into the church and take a short rest. Lutin also splits up the wings, keeping one and giving Selscior the other.\nThe Giant Rat that Makes All of the Rules\nWith that we headed to the smithy, again Ryean leapt into the sewer with the rest of us climbing down. Selscior leads the party down the tunnel. We finally arrived at the sister where the three main tunnels collected, we jumped down. On the far end we see a halfling in tattered clothes, muttering “rats, rats, rats” to himself. The party stops to discuss if we should attempt to talk to him. The halfling scratches his head with a foot, Selscior sneaks to his right. We decide to approach the man to try to talk to him, he sees us he screams “RATS!!!” we roll for initiative, he turns into a wererat.\nRyean immediately crits twice and kills a summoned rat, Lutin smites another rat. The self-appointed Rat King leaps into the muck sinking below the muck and emerges slashing at Lutin. Selscior casts hold person allowing Lutin to deal 69 damage and us to stack up the double damage. After an interesting combat all the rats flew and we head over to his tent.\nIts tent is made of rat pelts, sewn together with sinew, his pot and spoon is made of bone, his one possession is a wooden desk. It has a book made of rat leather, written with sewer sludge. There are several pages of “rat, rat, rat”, a few more about how much he likes rats, a few more about disliking rats, and lastly a confession of sorts.\nThe Rat Lord was from beggar camp, he stole a pendant from aristocracy and was caught. He ran away and escaped into the sewers. In a desk drawer is a golden pendant with a drawing of the family. Roland studies the drawing to recognize these people. In the back corner there is a stack of around a dozen bags of grain that we prestidigitation and surface with us.\nA Suspicious Bard\nOn the way to the Bailiffs quarters I see another group of orcs I recognize from Outskirts, I nod my head their way. We give the Bailiff the pendant, he informs us it is from the Karth family, they are fans of the lord. We decide we will next go along the river to collect herbs, delve into the forest to find the garden of Mae’s friend, and get back within the next week. Lutin, Ryean, and Dawn all head to Hammerhall to discuss a job they need done while Selscior and Roland head to the library. Apparently they are having issues getting ore from nearby mines, we need to head East to check out the mine. Selscior is able to convince the front desk to let Roland tag along as his body guard.\nSelscior starts looking into the history of the Elves, he finds a twenty-four volume set. Volume fifteen discusses the Great War. Apparently pre-Integration the Orcs and the Elves were the two predominant races and were able to coexist. After the appearance of humans and the Great Integration, the humans chopped and burned the forests of the elves. There is only one tree known to the world and it is within Bleakwoods. The book speculates there is a second, subterranean tree and elven civilization under the Tundra. He also does some research on the genealogy of the rulers of Altafaier.\nA Curious Paladin\nRoland begins with researching the reign of Castillo starting with general information about his family. In his autobiography “The Brilliant Mind of Castillo” I find out all of Borgeniss was once under control of Norgrain. He had two brothers, both younger, the older of the two left Borgeniss for the Greygard Mountains and joined a monastery. Later in life he returned to southern Norgrain started a farm and a family. The youngest brother died about forty years ago in a naval accident, his body was never recovered and was presumed dead. All he says about his removal from his title is that he was forced out by the other lords and that the only heir was his nephew Brauchuss. Roland also looks into the laws regarding libraries and colleges seeing what the punishment would be for infiltrating the college.\nWith all that we head to the Goldentide Inn, Selscior plays and gets fifteen gold in tips and free lodging. We each have quite visceral dreams in which we get taunted by a women with silver eyes. We are able to deduce this is the champion of the Moon Goddess Zephene. It would seem Selscior and his father had a poor run in with the law in Altafaier."
